            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>

            <li>Cooking Spray</li>

    <h3>Cooking Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place your pan on your stove</li>
            <li>Take the cooking spray and apply a light coating to the inside of your pan</li>
            <li>Grab the eggs, and gingerly tap one egg at a time on the rim of the pan until it cracks</li>
            <li>With your thumbs placed adjacent to the crack, apply pressure to the crack, causing the egg to open and release the yoke into the pan</li>
            <li>Repeat the process with the other egg</li>
            <li>After discarding the eggshells, turn the heat on your stove to low</li>
            <li>As the eggs cook, apply salt and pepper to preferred taste</li>
            <li>Let eggs simmer til the outer egg has turned a nice white, and the yolk yellow</li>
            <li>Using your spatula, carefully pick up one egg at a time and place them on a plate</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> for a more runny yoke, remove the eggs when they're a darker orange. For a more firm yolk remove the eggs when the yolk turns golden yellow.</p>
